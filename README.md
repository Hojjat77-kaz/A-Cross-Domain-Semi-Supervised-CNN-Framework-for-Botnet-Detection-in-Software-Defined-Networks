# Label-Efficient Botnet Detection in Software-Defined Networks via Cross-Domain CNN Learning
This repository provides the implementation of a cross-domain, semi-supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) framework for botnet detection in Software-Defined Networks (SDN). The proposed approach is designed to address two fundamental challenges in real-world SDN security: limited labeled data and poor generalization across network domains.

Unlike conventional intrusion detection systems that rely solely on fully supervised learning within a single dataset, this framework explicitly leverages cross-domain knowledge transfer and pseudo-labeling–based semi-supervised learning. A CNN model is first trained on a botnet-rich non-SDN dataset to capture generic botnet behavior, and then adapted to an SDN environment using only a small fraction of labeled SDN traffic. Unlabeled SDN flows are subsequently exploited through confidence-aware pseudo-labeling, allowing the model to improve detection performance under strict labeling constraints.

The framework is evaluated on CTU-13 and InSDN datasets using leakage-aware data splits and SDN-feasible flow-level features. Extensive experiments compare classical machine learning baselines, fully supervised CNNs, cross-domain transfer models, and semi-supervised student models. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves strong performance even with limited labeled data, while maintaining robustness under severe class imbalance.

This repository aims to support reproducible research by providing a unified experimental pipeline, consistent evaluation metrics, and clear separation between supervised, cross-domain, and semi-supervised learning settings.
